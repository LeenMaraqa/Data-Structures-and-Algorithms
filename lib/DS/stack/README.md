Stack Implementation in Dart

This is a simple Dart project that implements a Stack (Last In, First Out â€“ LIFO). And LIFO means that the most recently added item is the first one to be taken out.

Stack operations

push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
pop: Remove and return the top of stack.
peek: Return the top of stack.
isEmpty: Check if the stack has no elements.
size: Return the number of elements in the stack.
clear: Remove all elements in the stack.
